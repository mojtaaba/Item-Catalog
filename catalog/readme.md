8.cd to vagrant directory using command ```$ cd /vagrant```.    
9.Fill database from "newsdata.sql" file using this command ```$ psql -d news -f newsdata.sql```.

# views in the database
* ## topView
<span style="color:white">it is used to get the top titles based on the views</span>  
```
create view topView as   
   select articles.title,count(*) as total_view
   from log , articles,authors    
   where articles.slug=substr(log.path,10)
   and log.status='200 OK'
   group by articles.title order by total_view desc;
```

* ## topAuthor
<span style="color:white">it is used to get the top Author  based on the views</span>

   and articles.author=authors.id
   group by authors.name order by total_view desc;
```


* ## percentege

 create view percentege as   
   select time::date as Day_date ,
   ((sum(case when status !='200 OK' then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(*)*1.0))    
   as per from log group by time::date;
 ```


# Running the queries:
  1. From the vagrant directory inside the virtual machine,run Logs_Analysis.py using:
  ```
    $ python3 Logs_Analysis.py
  ```


# Note:
- always make sure you are running your command in vagrant VM directory
- to reconnect to the news database You can connect using this command ```psql -d news```
